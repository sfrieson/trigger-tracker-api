# TriggerTracker (API)

TriggerTracker is an App that a person can use to track what they're eating and how it relates to negative reactions they might have so that they might figure out trigger foods for migraines, upset stomachs, allergies, hangovers, and other symptoms through data.

This repository is for the API portion of the app where requests are received from the Web portion. These user's input is stored and analyzed here as well.

## Technologies

- GraphQL
I really enjoy the ideas behind GraphQL and Apollo Server (Express) made it quick and easy to get the server up and running for all I needed.
- PostgreSQL
I am using this project as a way to practice SQL queries, so there is no ORM except the one I'm creating for only this app's use cases. Some inspiration is being taken from the Ruby on Rails structure.
