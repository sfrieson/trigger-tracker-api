# TriggerTracker (API)

TriggerTracker is an App that a person can use to track what they're eating and how it relates to negative reactions they might have so that they might figure out trigger foods for migraines, upset stomachs, allergies, hangovers, and other symptoms through data.

This repository is for the API portion of the app where requests are received from the Web portion. These user's input is stored and analyzed here as well.

## Technologies

- GraphQL
I really enjoy the ideas behind GraphQL and Apollo Server (Express) made it quick and easy to get the server up and running for all I needed.
- MongoDB
I generally don't like using NoSQL databases, but after starting this project with PostgreSQL, I realized that this is actually quite a good use for NoSQL.  There are no relationships involved (at least yet). This project will mainly just be a collection of data.  We'll see how well this works.
